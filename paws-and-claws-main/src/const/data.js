It is not uncommon for elderly sheep to lose weight, which could be due to various issues such as dental disease, an underlying health condition (such as OPP), or eating less due to environmental factors or social dynamics. You should be very mindful of an older sheep’s weight so that you can catch weight loss early. It’s important to identify the cause of the weight loss, take steps to address the issue, and make changes to their diet, living arrangement, and/or environment, based on their needs.",
